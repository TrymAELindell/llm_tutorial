# Basic local LLM tutorial
This is a very basic tutorial for running local llms using langchain and ollama

To easily run the code in the project you will need to install poetry and ollama first

For poetry see:
- https://python-poetry.org/docs/
- https://python-poetry.org/docs/basic-usage/ 

For ollama see:
- https://ollama.com/ 

For more teoretical understanding of llms I recommend 3blue1brown's videos on the transformer architecture (he also provides additional links to other sources) and Andrej Karpathy's videos on llms. Both are found on youtube
